A wiki about large language models (LLMs). Using Quartz to deploy a static site.

I grew tired of trying to find a single place that covered all of the metadata regarding large language models (LLMs), so this is my attempt to consolidate that information into one place. It also gives me a chance to try and use some of the newer AI-powered scraping libraries, like [Scrapegraph-ai](https://github.com/VinciGit00/Scrapegraph-ai) and [Firecrawl](https://github.com/mendableai/firecrawl).
