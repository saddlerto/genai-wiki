title: Welcome to the GenAI Wiki
---

This wiki covers topics related to generative AI (artificial intelligence). The inspiration for this wiki was my desire to find and share information about large language models (LLMs), multi-modal LLMs, and other related projects.

I also wanted an opportunity to explore the use of some of the newer AI-based tools for scaping like [Scrapegraph-ai](https://github.com/VinciGit00/Scrapegraph-ai) and [Firecrawl](https://github.com/mendableai/firecrawl).

This wiki will hopefully be a living document that is generated by scraping publicly available pages, and gathering useful metadata.
